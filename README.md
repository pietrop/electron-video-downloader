## Possible todo to extend the app: 
- [x] add check box option for [downloading associated subtitles](https://github.com/przemyslawpluta/node-youtube-dl#downloading-subtitles). 
- [x] support languages other then english when downloading captions.  
- [x] if url is of playlist, then [download playlist](https://github.com/przemyslawpluta/node-youtube-dl#downloading-playlists)
- [ ] show [list of extractors in app](https://github.com/przemyslawpluta/node-youtube-dl#getting-the-list-of-extractors) _half implemented, but vimeo not working_
- [ ] _optional_ a video preview for select url.  
- [ ] figure out a way to support direct url to video, eg not from supported extractors.  
- [x] Add CSS styling (needs checking if `youtube-dl` works cross platform).
- [x] Package app and make release.
- [x] Check if app works on osx, 
- [ ] Check if app works windows, 
- [ ] Check if app works linux. 
- [x] add a logo. 
- [ ] refactor yotube downloader as separate component.
- [ ] add possibility for user to set default destination folder, as opposed to `Movie` in home folder on osx.
- [x] change `var destDownloadFolder  = app.getPath("videos");` to be a default, corresponds to `Movie` folder.
	- [x] with a promt to change dest folder to prefered one, 
	- [ ] and rember choice, eg in local storage`?`


- [ ] Add `human` vs `automated` label to text file of captions to distinguish is downloading both one after the other.
- [ ] escape emoji, sometimes emojis are in the title, and that's hard to parse/read/save.
